    <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Boneless Skinless Chicken Breasts: I prefer to use chicken breasts, but you can also use chicken thighs.</li>
            <li>Olive Oil: I like to use extra virgin olive oil for the health benefits, but you can also use vegetable oil.</li>
            <li>Low Sodium Soy Sauce: Low sodium soy sauce will cut down on the salt content in this recipe.</li>
            <li>Water: for the teriyaki sauce</li>
            <li>Brown Sugar: Adds a sweetness to the sauce. You can use light or dark brown sugar.</li>
            <li>Rice Vinegar: Is commonly used in Asian dishes.</li>
            <li>Sesame Oil: Adds a great flavor to the sauce, but this is also optional.</li>
            <li>Minced Garlic: I prefer to use fresh minced garlic over garlic powder.</li>
            <li>Ginger: Ground ginger works great in this teriyaki sauce. Itâ€™s easy to use and most people have it on hand.</li>
            <li>Honey: Adds a sweet flavor to the sauce, and also helps to thicken the sauce.</li>
            <li>Cornstarch: Adding cornstarch to the teriyaki sauce with thicken the sauce to coat the chicken.</li>
            <li>Rice for serving: Use white rice, brown rice, or quinoa.</li>
            <li>Vegetables for serving: Fresh steamed carrots and broccoli compliment this chicken great.</li>
        </ul>
    <h3><strong>Steps</strong></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by heating oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat and add cubed chicken.</li>
            <li>Brown Chicken until it is cooked through and no longer pink in the middle. Drain excess liquid if any.</li>
            <li>While Chicken is browning, prepare your teriyaki sauce! In a medium size mixing bowl whisk together soy sauce, water, honey, brown sugar, rice vinegar, sesame oil, ginger, garlic, and cornstarch.</li>
            <li>Once Chicken is browned and cooked through, add your homemade teriyaki sauce to your skillet and continue to cook stirring until the sauce has thickened.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately with white or brown rice and vegetables of your choice. Garnish with sesame seeds and green onion</li>
            <li>If you like extra teriyaki sauce with your meal, make extra to drizzle on top of your rice bowl</li>
        </ol>
