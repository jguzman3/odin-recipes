Project: Recipes
Date: June 5, 2022
This is me testing my knowledge of HTML in practice to put together a basic recipe website. The website will contain an index page with links to a couple of recipes in order to demonstrate my ability to utilize basic HTML.

Date June 6, 2022 (PROJECT PLAN)
1) Create README.md and the index.HTML to demonstrate basic HTML
2) Create Recipe pages and properly link back to index.HTML
3) Complete a recipe page utilizing headings, images, organized and unorganized lists, paragraphs, italics, and bolded characters as needed
4) Complete the rest of the recipe pages to further demonstrate understandings of items in step 3

Completed the HTML portion of the recipe project. The project so far has been pretty self explanatory. Most of my time was spent creating the website from scratch rather than running into any errors throughout the process.
